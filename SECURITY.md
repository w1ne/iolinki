## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in `iolinki`, please do NOT open a public issue.

Instead, please report it via:

1.  **GitHub Private Reporting**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the `Security` tab if enabled.
2.  **Email**: Contact the maintainers directly (details in `AUTHORS` or via GitHub profile).

We will investigate all reports and provide a fix as soon as possible.
